# Short- and long-wave radiative flux modeling

under construction

<!-- Short- and long-wave radiative fluxes are a key component of the energy balance of the snow cover. Specifically

## Incoming short-wave radiation
Incoming short-wave radiation strongly varies in time and space depending on terrain position and atmospheric state. To regionalise point measurements, openAMUNDSEN calculates potential global radiation for each grid cell based on position of the sun, orographic shadows, local aspect and slope, atmospheric composition (aerosols, water vapour content), multiple reflections between snow and clouds as well as from snow covered neighbouring slopes. Calculated potential global radiation is then compared to observed global radiation to determine cloud coverage. In the final step, cloud coverage is regionalised using the methods described in [Processing meteo data](/des/meteo), and actual incoming short-wave radiation is calculated from potential global radiation and cloud coverage for each model grid cell.

## Outgoing / reflected short-wave radiation
Reflected short wave radiation depends on surface albedo, i.e. the ability to reflect incoming short-wave radiation. For snow, albedo varies with snow characteristics like grain size, density and snow impurity. In openAMUNDSEN, snow albedo is modelled using an ageing-curve approach (Citation xxx).

## Incoming long-wave radiation
Incoming long-wave radiation from the sky is a function of atmospheric composition and temperature and is determined using the the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Atmospheric emissivity thereby depends on water vapour content in clear sky conditions and cloud cover in overcast situations. Additionally, openAMUNDSEN accounts for long-wave radiation from the neighbouring slopes.

## Outgoing / emitted long-wave radiation
Outgoing long-wave radiation is calculated following the Stephan-Boltzmann law with the emissivity of snow and modelled snow surface temperature.
