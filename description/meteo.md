# Processing and regionalisation of meteorological input data

under construction

<!-- openAMUNDSEN calculates the described processes for each model grid cell and use meteorological forcing from different sources. In order to transfer point measurements to an area and considering the fact that meteo variables change with varying topographic characteristics in alpine terrain, openAMUNDSEN offers different approaches to deal with the regionalisation problem of meteorological forcing data.

## Required meteorological input data

- air temperature
- precipitation
- global radiation
- wind speed
- rel. humidity

## optional input data
- incoming longwave radiation

## Read grids
An option to directly read in gridded meteorological data is in development.

## Read stations

## Regionalisation of station data

###

### Regression-based approach

### Monthly altitudinal gradients
